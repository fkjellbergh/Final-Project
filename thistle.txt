              THISTLE KNIGHT JOURNAL ENTRY
I believe I have found the entrance to Araneae.
After investigating the crevice on La Feye I stumbled upon a long corridor.
I hear strange sounds as I walk through this cave of a hall. 
I have heard that the doors to Araneae are protected by giant spiders but surely
these are only rumors. 
I entered one of the side chambers and found a chest and hallelujah I have found 
evidence that this is the entrance to the fallen city! A vial, filled with the healing elixir 
that was lost with the secrets of Araneae. I hear something getting closer. Perhaps I shall 
come back with more supplies to continue my investigation on a different day. Something tells
me I am not alone...
